# Excel-To-Anki
A simple example relying on Kerrick Staley's genanki (https://github.com/kerrickstaley) and pandas to process an Excel table and turn it into an Anki Deck.  

All the material that can be found both in the Anki flashcards and in the Excel file comes from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/dp-900 or is derived from it. I am planning on creating a separate repository in the near future for these Microsoft courses Anki Decks, but I will leave this one as an example.

I wrote the script in the Jupyter Notebook myself, mainly relying on genanki examples found in genanki's repo or in some of its issues. Feel free to use it for whatever purposes (double check the license either way).

While I would consider all this to be safe, I assume no responsibility if using this software and the attached files ruins your Anki streak, provokes any kind of damage, you feel like it was a huge waste of your time, or anything else. Use it at your own risk and under your own responsibility.
